----

The estimates, by GBPU, of unreported mortality is from the GitHub repo:
<a href="https://github.com/bcgov/GB_Unreported" class="uri">https://github.com/bcgov/GB_Unreported</a>
Additional input data is generated by the GB\_Data GitHub

### Usage

There are 10 scripts that are avaialble for the analysis, they need to
be run in order:

-   01\_load.R
-   02\_clean\_CI.R - aggregrates cumpulsory inspection data into a
    single shape file
-   02\_clean\_GBPU.R - summarizes CI data by GBPU
-   02\_clean\_WMU.R - summarizes CI data by WMU
-   03\_analysis\_GBPU.R - calculates female mortality by GBPU
-   03\_analysis\_WMU.R - calculates female mortality by WMU
-   03\_analysis\_WMU\_to\_GBPU.R - calculates female mortality by WMU
    then summarizes to GBPU
-   04\_output\_GBPU.R - generates GBPU summary table
-   04\_output\_WMU.R - generates WMU summary table
-   04\_output\_WMU\_to\_GBPU.R - generates GBPU summary table
